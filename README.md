# NBP
National Board of Pensions (NBP)

* Project comes with Flake8 & Black Formatter. Just install their VSCode extensions and the configurations will be picked up from .flake8 and pyproject.toml files.
* The project requires a .env file to run, I have provided a .env.example file with the required keys, you just need to fill in the values, these can be obtained from the system administrator.
